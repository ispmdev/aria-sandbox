            <p>BRAVE LITTLE HUNTER's location is currently unknown, and that's a good thing. Towers explained, "We went out and surveyed the area the day after that she was free, and we didn’t see or hear her at all, which was excellent news. It just means that she's on the move, which is great. That's the best kind of outcome we can hope for right now," he said.</p>
            <blockquote>
                “It’s only a matter of time really until this whale is photographed again, either by herself or most likely with another group of Bigg's killer whales. So we just have to be patient and be on the lookout for that.”
